# oms_datapack
### Minecraft Datapacks used for Our Minecraft Server

Our Minecraft Server (OMS) is a semi-private Minecraft server hosted by Optim00se.
This repository is a way to download and modify the datapacks used on OMS.

File structure:
~/oms(version)/(datapack)

example: ~/oms_superflat/oms_WT

The version for each datapack will be in a txt file in each oms(version) directory.
